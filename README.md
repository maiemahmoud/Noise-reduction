# Noise-reduction
noise reduction models using auto-encoder model and N2V model.
the first model make image noise reduction using auto encoder which applied on OFDM channel noise.
The second model uses auto encoder also to make noise reduction but on two kind of noise(the one from the OFDM channel and the other from the cables).
The thisd model uses N2V model to reduce image noise. It applied only on OFDM noise and will be enhanced to be applied on other combinations of noise.
